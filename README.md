# Blaise File Upload 👽

## Overview

Blaise File Upload Alien is a minimal ASP.NET Core Web API (using .NET 10) for managing file uploads. It is designed as a **proof of concept** to demonstrate file upload handling for Blaise questionnaires. The API works both locally (as a console app) and as a Windows service on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VM. It exposes endpoints for uploading and deleting files and stores files with metadata and unique IDs. Logging is automatically configured for both local development and GCP environments.

> **Note:** Files are uploaded to the RAT cloud storage bucket. Currently work is underway to add a pipeline

> **Test Questionnaire:** A `test-questionnaire` folder is included, containing a sample questionnaire that will upload a file to the endpoint of this application/service.

## Features

- **File Upload API**: Accepts file uploads via HTTP POST to `/api/file`.
- **Metadata Storage**: Stores files with metadata and a unique identifier.
- **Environment Detection**: Automatically detects if running locally or on a GCP VM.
- **Logging**:
    - Logs to the console when running locally.
    - Logs to both the console and Google Cloud Logging (Stackdriver) when running on a GCP VM.
- **Swagger UI**: API documentation and testing via Swagger at `/swagger`.


## Requirements

- **.NET 10 SDK** is required to build and publish the application. [Download .NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)
- **.NET Hosting Bundle** is required on the target machine to run the published app as a Windows service. [Download Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)

## Running Locally

1. Restore and publish the application (requires .NET 10 SDK):
    ```
    dotnet restore
    dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o \BlaiseServices\BlaiseFileUploadAlien\
    ```

2. To upload to a sandbox GCP project, ensure you specify it in Properties/launchSettings.json (e.g., `ons-blaise-v2-dev-<sandbox>-rat`).

    ```
    {
      "profiles": {
        "BlaiseFileUploadAlien": {
          "commandName": "Project",
          "launchBrowser": true,
          "environmentVariables": {
            "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
            "ENV_BLAISE_RAT_BUCKET": "ons-blaise-v2-dev-<sandbox>-rat"
          },
          "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:55163;http://localhost:55164"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Authenticate your local machine

    ```
    gcloud config set project ons-blaise-v2-dev-<sandbox>
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

4. Run the application as a console app (requires .NET 10 Hosting Bundle installed):
    ```
    cd \BlaiseServices\BlaiseFileUploadAlien\
    .\BlaiseFileUploadAlien.exe
    ```

5. Access the API at [http://localhost:5123/swagger](http://localhost:5123/swagger) for documentation and testing.


## Running on a GCP VM (as a Windows Service)

1. Publish and copy the output to your GCP VM (requires .NET 10 SDK for publishing, .NET 10 Hosting Bundle for running).

2. Create and start the Windows service:
    ```
    sc.exe create "BlaiseFileUploadAlien" binpath= "C:\BlaiseServices\BlaiseFileUploadAlien\BlaiseFileUploadAlien.exe"
    sc.exe config "BlaiseFileUploadAlien" start= auto
    sc.exe start "BlaiseFileUploadAlien"
    ```

3. The service will automatically detect it is running on GCP and log to Google Cloud Logging (Stackdriver) as well as the console.


## API Usage

- **POST** `/api/file`
    - Accepts a JSON body with:
        - `Id` (int): Case or file identifier
        - `FileMeta` (string): Metadata for the file
        - `File` (int[]): File contents as an array of bytes
    - Returns: The filename used to store the file (including a short unique ID and extension)

- **POST** `/api/file/delete`
  - Deletes the named file from the configured GCP storage bucket.
  - Accepts a JSON body with:
    - `Filename` (string): The filename returned by `POST /api/file`.
  - `Filename` must be a non-empty plain filename and must not contain `/`, `\`, `../`, or `..\` path components.
  - Responses:
    - `204 No Content`: The file was deleted.
    - `400 Bad Request`: The supplied filename is invalid.
    - `404 Not Found`: The file does not exist in the bucket.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: The deletion could not be completed.

## Environment Detection & Logging

- The application checks for the GCP metadata server to determine if it is running on a GCP VM.
- If running on GCP, it uses the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable for the project ID (required for logging to Stackdriver).
- Locally, only console logging is enabled.

## Notes

- Uploaded files are stored in `C:\BlaiseFileUploads` by default.
- Ensure the service account on GCP has permission to write logs to Google Cloud Logging.
